# Movie-Seat-Selector
Project Description
The Movie Seat Selector is a simple and interactive web application that allows users to select seats in a movie theater layout. The app helps visualize the seating arrangement, showing available, selected, and booked seats. Once users select their desired seats, the app calculates the total cost based on the number of seats chosen.

This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to dynamically update the seat selection and display relevant information to the user in real-time.

Features
Dynamic Seat Selection: Users can select or deselect seats by clicking on the available seats.
Price Calculation: Total price is automatically calculated based on the number of selected seats and the ticket price.
UI Updates: Seats visually change color based on their status (available, selected, booked).
Local Storage: Saves selected seats and movie choice so that the selection persists after refreshing the page.
Movie Selection: Users can choose from different movies, each with its own ticket price.

Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the page content and layout.
CSS: For styling the seats, layout, and overall design of the page.
JavaScript: For adding interactivity, managing seat selection, and calculating the total price.
